Data Structure and Algorithm Homework 3

The directories contain:

- `cpp`

    C++ version provided code. These includes a sample `Makefile`,
    partially-finished `src/hw3_1.cpp` and several utility files.

- `ref`

    Reference implementations. The `linux-x86_64` works on the
    CSIE workstation.

- `tests`

    Sample test case of the problem. The number in the filename
    stands for the degree of difficulty of the test cases. We
    separate the test case into 2 categorires, `basic` and
    `advanced`. Though tests in both categories should work if
    you correctly implemented `hw3_1` (with provided code),
    the tests in `advanced` categories uses more advanced part
    in the langauge (and some syntactic extensions)

    Given a test case `nnn-XXXX`,

    * `nnn-XXXX.t` is the input expression
    * `nnn-XXXX.s` is the (sample) generated instructions
    * `nnn-XXXX.ref` is the result of running the instructions
        on SVM.
