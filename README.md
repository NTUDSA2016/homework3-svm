Data Structure and Algorithm Homework 3

The directories contain:

- `cpp`

    C++ version of the provided code. These include a sample `Makefile`,
    the partially finished `src/hw3_1.cpp` and several library files.

- `ref`

    Reference implementations. The `linux-x86_64` version
    works on any of the CSIE workstations.

    We will use the reference `hw3_2` for grading your
    programming homework on CSIE workstations.

- `tests`

    Sample test case of the problem. The number in the filename
    stands for the degree of difficulty of the test case. We
    split the test case into 2 categorires, namely `basic` and
    `advanced`. Though tests in both categories should work if
    you have correctly implemented `hw3_1` (with provided code),
    the tests in `advanced` categories use more advanced part
    in the language (and some syntactic extensions)

    Given a test case `nnn-XXXX`,

    * `nnn-XXXX.t` is the input expression
    * `nnn-XXXX.s` is the (sample) generated instructions
    * `nnn-XXXX.ref` is the result of running the instructions on SVM.
